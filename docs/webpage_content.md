**Verdant**

**Building Trusted Pathways Between Global Manufacturing and India**

A principal-led platform enabling market entry, distribution, and
long-term partnerships across India's manufacturing ecosystem.

Verdant works with global manufacturing and industrial technology
companies to help them enter, scale, and succeed in India --- and with
Indian OEMs and manufacturers to access differentiated global
technologies and partners.

India is one of the world's most opportunity-rich and
execution-intensive manufacturing markets. Success here requires more
than market reports or channel partners. It requires operating
experience, credibility, and a deep understanding of how decisions are
made on the ground. Verdant exists to provide exactly that.

**The Principal**

Verdant is led by **Nidhi Shah**, an operator who has introduced, built,
and scaled entirely new manufacturing technologies in India, with over
two decades of experience across Indian and international markets.

Across her career, Nidhi has been responsible for bringing advanced
manufacturing technologies to India at a time when they were largely
unknown --- shaping market understanding, building credibility, and
guiding customers through adoption until these technologies became
established and commercially viable.

She has worked extensively across India, Europe, the US, ASEAN, and ANZ,
and has held senior leadership roles at ExOne Global Holdings (erstwhile
voxeljet AG), Imaginarium Solutions, and in multiple market-entry and
advisory engagements.

Verdant reflects this operator-led perspective --- focused on market
creation, technology adoption, and long-term value, not short-term
transactions.

**What Verdant Does**

**India Market Entry & Scale-Up**

Verdant supports global manufacturing and industrial technology
companies that are serious about India.

Engagements span the full market-entry and scale-up lifecycle:

- Market assessment and entry strategy

- Go-to-market and pricing localisation

- Partner and distributor identification

- Early customer access and reference development

- Ongoing market development and scaling

The emphasis is on execution and adoption --- converting interest into
durable market presence.

**Distribution & Representation in India**

Verdant selectively represents high value, differentiated manufacturing
technologies and industrial solutions in India.

This includes:

- Acting as India distributor or commercial representative

- Building and managing key accounts

- Developing long-term sales pipelines

- Positioning offerings for Indian buying behaviour and procurement
  structures

Representation mandates are chosen carefully, with a clear focus on
long-term market creation rather than transactional sales.

**Buyer--Seller Connectivity**

Verdant connects the right buyers and sellers across borders, with clear
commercial intent.

This includes:

- Global suppliers engaging with Indian OEMs and Tier 1 manufacturers

- Indian manufacturers accessing global customers or technology partners

- Structured introductions aligned on readiness, relevance, and mutual
  value

Connectivity is selective and purpose-driven --- not volume-based.

**India Entry Advisory**

Verdant provides India-specific strategic advisory grounded in operating
reality.

Typical engagements include:

- Market and ecosystem mapping

- Competitive and partner landscape analysis

- India-specific risk, compliance, and execution considerations

- Entry sequencing and investment planning

Advisory work is typically time-bound or retainer-based and closely
aligned with on-ground execution.

**The Network**

Verdant operates across the breadth of the Indian manufacturing
ecosystem, including:

- Large automotive, aerospace, energy, and industrial OEMs

- Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers

- Advanced manufacturing and industrial technology providers

- Family-owned manufacturing groups and professionally managed
  enterprises

Internationally, Verdant works closely with European and US
manufacturing SMEs, industrial technology companies, and investors
evaluating India as a growth market.

This network has been built over years of delivery and trust --- not
cold outreach.

**Who Verdant Works With**

Verdant works selectively with:

- International manufacturing SMEs entering or expanding in India

- Industrial technology companies seeking long-term representation in
  India

- Indian OEMs and manufacturers pursuing differentiated global
  partnerships

- Investors and founders evaluating India as a manufacturing, sourcing,
  or sales base

Engagements are senior-led, relationship-driven, and outcome-focused.

**How Engagements Are Structured**

Engagement models are flexible and aligned to client objectives:

- India distributor or commercial representative

- Market entry and scale-up projects

- Ongoing advisory retainers

- Structured commercial or strategic partnerships

Verdant prioritises depth, alignment, and long-term outcomes.

**Philosophy**

India is not a single market. It is a collection of industries, regions,
ownership structures, and decision-making cultures.

Verdant's approach is based on:

- Respect for local realities

- Alignment between global ambition and Indian execution

- Long-term relationship building

- Commercial discipline

Success in India is rarely fast --- but it is durable when done right.

**Start the Conversation**

If you are a global manufacturing or industrial technology company
serious about India --- or an Indian manufacturer seeking meaningful
global partnerships --- Verdant can help you navigate the path forward.

Engagements typically begin with a focused conversation to assess fit,
intent, and readiness.
